**Your Current Status: NOT YET ELIGIBLE**
You cannot apply for naturalization under INA 319(a) until you have been married to your US citizen spouse for a full 3 years.

**What You Need to Do:**

2. **Gather required documents** during this waiting period
3. **File Form I-131** if you need to travel again before applying
4. **Submit Form N-400** after reaching 3-year marriage anniversary

**Timeline:**
- **Now**: Start gathering documents
- **4 months from now**: File N-400 application
- **12-18 months later**: Naturalization interview
- **Total time to citizenship**: 16-22 months

**Important Notes:**
- Your 6-month absence is acceptable and won't break continuous residence
- The 3-month trip to care for your mother may qualify for exception
- Keep all travel records and medical documentation
- Consider consulting an immigration attorney for complex travel scenarios

**Legal Recommendations:**
‚Ä¢ Review all requirements carefully before proceeding
‚Ä¢ Consult with an immigration attorney for complex cases
