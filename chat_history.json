Family-Based Immigrant Visa Petitions (Section: Part B)\n- B. Background\nThe family-based petition process describes the process by which a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident (LPR) petitions for an adopted child, son, or daughter.\u00a0The petition process establishes the petitioner\u2019s [5] relationship to an adopted child, son, or daughter so that the adoptee beneficiary can apply to become an LPR. [6]\nFiling a family-based petition [7] is the first step for an adopted child, son, or daughter to become an LPR. The filing or approval of the petition does not give the adoptee beneficiary any immigration status or benefit. Generally, if the petition is approved, the adoptee beneficiary will need to take additional steps to become an LPR. (Section: Part E)\n- B. Background\nThe family-based petition process describes the process by which a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident (LPR) petitions for an adopted child, son, or daughter.\u00a0The petition process establishes the petitioner\u2019s [5] relationship to an adopted child, son, or daughter so that the adoptee beneficiary can apply to become an LPR. [6]\nFiling a family-based petition [7] is the first step for an adopted child, son, or daughter to become an LPR. The filing or approval of the petition does not give the adoptee beneficiary any immigration status or benefit. Generally, if the petition is approved, the adoptee beneficiary will need to take additional steps to become an LPR. (Section: Part E)\n- A final adoption was completed before the child turned 16 (or 18 if the sibling exception applies); [25] and\nThe child has been in the legal custody of and jointly resided with a U.S. citizen or LPR adoptive parent for at least 2 years at the time of filing the petition.\nUSCIS does not have the authority to waive the 2-year legal custody and 2-year joint residence requirement for a family-based petition, except for certain battered children. [26]\nIf a U.S. citizen petitioner who was not habitually resident in the United States at the time of adoption decides to move to the United States, USCIS cannot approve a family-based petition for the child before the petitioner has satisfied the 2 year legal custody and 2 year joint residence requirements. [27]\nIf the child is from a Hague Adoption Convention country, a U.S. citizen petitioner cannot follow the family-based petition process unless the petitioner establishes that the Hague Adoption Convention does not apply. [28]\nThe family-based petition process involves a USCIS determination that the child is eligible to immigrate as the adopted child, son, or daughter [29] of the petitioner. In contrast to the other two processes, the family-based petition process does not involve a USCIS determination of the adoptive parent\u2019s suitability.\nTo pursue the family-based petition process, the petitioner may file a Petition for Alien Relative ( Form I-130 ). [30]\nThe adoptive parent-child relationship [31] is recognized in all applicable immigration requests under U.S. immigration law, including, but not limited to:\nRefugee/Asylee Relative Petition ( Form I-730 );\nApplication for Certificate of Citizenship ( Form N-600 );\nApplication for Citizenship and Issuance of Certificate Under Section 322 ( Form N-600K ); or (Section: Part A)\n- A beneficiary of a family-based immigrant petition may concurrently file to adjust status in certain circumstances. [4] For example, since immediate relatives are not subject to numerical limitations on visa availability, an immediate relative beneficiary who is in the United States may file an Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status ( Form I-485 ) concurrently with the immigrant petition or after it is approved. [5]\nGenerally, family-based petitions must be filed with USCIS. [6] However, there are limited circumstances where the U.S. Department of State (DOS) may accept and adjudicate Form I-130. USCIS no longer accepts and adjudicates routine Form I-130 petitions at its international field offices.

Purpose\nThe family-based petition process is one of the three processes for a beneficiary to immigrate to the United States based on adoption. [1] Unlike the Hague Adoption Convention [2] or orphan processes, eligibility for the family-based process generally requires the adoptee beneficiary to have been in the legal custody of and jointly resided with the adoptive parent for at least 2 years (amongst other requirements), [3] and it does not require a USCIS determination of the adoptive parent\u2019s suitability.\nThere are certain restrictions for U.S. citizens on using the family-based petition process for an adoptee beneficiary from a Hague Adoption Convention country. USCIS can only approve a family-based petition filed by a U.S. citizen for an adoptee beneficiary from a Hague Adoption Convention country under limited circumstances. [4] (Section: Part E)\n- A.

(Section: Part C)\n- B.\u00a0Background\nThe Refugee Act of 1980 not only provided for the admission and adjustment of status of refugees but also established procedures for aliens to seek asylum. Prior to the Refugee Act, there was no mechanism for someone in the\u00a0United States\u00a0to apply for protection under the Refugee Convention. The Refugee Act required the establishment of a procedure for an alien who meets the definition of a refugee to apply for and be granted asylum if physically present in the United States regardless of the person\u2019s immigration status.\nThe Refugee Act provided for the adjustment of status of asylees to permanent residents. Unlike refugees, asylees are not required to apply for adjustment of status\u00a01\u00a0year after receiving asylum. Instead, an\u00a0asylee\u00a0may apply for adjustment of status after accruing\u00a01\u00a0year of physical presence after receiving asylum status. The\u00a0asylee\u00a0is not required to apply within a specific time frame.\nAlthough the Refugee Act exempted asylees from the worldwide annual limitations on immigrants, the law placed a ceiling of 5,000 on the number of asylees who could adjust to permanent resident status each year. The Immigration Act of 1990 increased the annual ceiling to 10,000 and waived the annual limit for those asylees who met the required\u00a01-year physical presence requirement and filed for adjustment of status on or before June 1, 1990. In 2005, the REAL ID Act [1] permanently eliminated the annual cap on the number of asylees allowed to adjust status.

[1]\nLautenberg Parolees\nAs part of a program under the Lautenberg Amendment first introduced in 1990, certain\u00a0aliens\u00a0from the former Soviet Union found to be ineligible for refugee status and whose applications are denied can be offered parole into the\u00a0United States. These\u00a0persons\u00a0include, but are not necessarily limited to: (Section: Part L)\n- of\u00a0Status\u00a0and Notice to Appear Considerations [ 7 USCIS-PM L.6 ].\n[^ 10] See 92 Stat. 907, 909 (October 5, 1978).\n[^ 11] See 8 CFR 209.1(a)(2) .\n[^ 12] See INA 101(a)(15)(J) .\n[^ 13] The foreign residency exemption in 8 CFR 209.2(b) extends to refugee and asylum-based adjustment of status. The Immigration Benefits Business Transformation, Increment I Final Rule revised 8 CFR 209.2(b) by adding the language \u201cunder this part\u201d to exempt both asylee and refugee adjustment applicants from the 2-year foreign residence requirement in INA 212(e) if they were previously nonimmigrant exchange visitors (J-nonimmigrants) and therefore subject to this requirement. The final rule also added 8 CFR 209.1(f) as a waiver of inadmissibility provision for refugee adjustment applications, matching the existing provision for asylee adjustment applications at 8 CFR 209.2(b) .

Derivative refugees do not have to maintain their familial relationship to the principal refugee after admission to the United States\u00a0to be eligible to adjust status.

Applicants Admitted as Refugees\nTo be eligible for adjustment of status as an Afghanistan or Iraq national special immigrant, an alien must have been either paroled into the United States or admitted as a nonimmigrant. [29] An alien who last entered the United States as a refugee is not paroled and is admitted as a refugee, not a nonimmigrant. Thus, an alien admitted as a refugee cannot adjust status under any of the Afghanistan or Iraq programs as refugees have their own basis for adjusting status.
