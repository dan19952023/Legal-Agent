    "content": "To obtain a marriage-based green card (also known as a spousal immigrant visa), there are several requirements that both the U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident (LPR) spouse and the foreign spouse must meet:\n\n1. **Valid Marriage**:\n   - The marriage must be legally valid in the jurisdiction where it took place and recognized under U.S. immigration law.\n   - Common law marriages are recognized if valid in the state where the marriage was established.\n\n2. **Good Faith Marriage**:\n   - The marriage must have been entered into in good faith and not for the purpose of evading immigration laws. The couple must have the intention of establishing a life together.\n\n3. **Eligibility of the U.S. Citizen or LPR**:\n   - The U.S. citizen or LPR spouse must be able to sponsor their foreign spouse by submitting the necessary petitions and documentation.\n\n4. **Filing the Petition**:\n   - Form I-130 (Petition for Alien Relative) must be filed by the U.S. citizen or LPR spouse.\n   - If the foreign spouse is already in the U.S., they may also need to file Form I-485 (Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status) simultaneously or after the I-130 is approved.\n\n5. **Documentation Requirements**:\n   - Proof of the validity of the marriage (e.g., marriage certificate)\n   - Evidence of a bona fide relationship (e.g., joint leases, shared bank accounts, photos together, affidavits from friends and family)\n   - Documentation showing that the marriage is not fraudulent (e.g., no prior marriage fraud, no attempts to enter into a sham marriage)\n\n6. **Background Checks and Interviews**:\n   - Both spouses may be subject to background checks, and they will likely need to attend an interview with USCIS to demonstrate the genuineness of the marriage.\n\n7. **Criminal Background**:\n   - The U.S. citizen or LPR spouse should not be barred from sponsoring the foreign spouse due to certain criminal convictions.\n\n8. **Financial Support**:\n   - The U.S. citizen or LPR spouse must demonstrate the ability to financially support the foreign spouse, typically through Form I-864 (Affidavit of Support).\n\n9. **Continuous Residence**:\n   - If applicable, the couple must demonstrate that they continue to reside together in the U.S. after the marriage.\n\nIf you have specific cases or additional questions regarding the marriage-based green card process, feel free to ask!"

Prior Marriage Fraud\nSelf-petitioning spouses are required to demonstrate a qualifying spousal relationship and that their marriage was entered into in good faith. [26] Even if the self-petitioner meets these two eligibility requirements, USCIS cannot approve the self-petition where it determines with substantial and probative evidence that the self-petitioner previously:\nHad been granted or has sought to be accorded an immediate relative or family-based preference status as the spouse of a U.S. citizen or LPR based on a marriage that USCIS has determined the self-petitioner entered into for the purpose of evading immigration laws; or\nAttempted or conspired to enter into a marriage for the purpose of evading immigration laws. [27]\nWhere USCIS determines there is substantial and probative evidence that the self-petitioner previously engaged in marriage fraud, the burden shifts to the self-petitioner to overcome the finding. [28] Officers may not rely solely on a prior finding of marriage fraud but must make a separate and independent determination that the self-petitioner previously engaged in marriage fraud. [29]\nUSCIS provides self-petitioners with an opportunity to rebut the evidence that they entered into or conspired to enter into a prior marriage for the purpose of evading immigration laws by issuing an Request for Evidence (RFE) or a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID).

The self-petitioner must also establish that the marriage was entered into in good faith and was not entered into for the purpose of evading immigration laws. [98]\nTo demonstrate a good faith marriage, self-petitioning spouses must show that at the time of the marriage, they intended to establish a life together with the U.S. citizen or LPR. USCIS does not deny a self-petition, however, solely because the spouses are not living together, or the marriage is no longer viable. [99] Additionally, separation from the U.S. citizen or LPR spouse, even shortly after the marriage took place, does not prove by itself that a marriage was not entered into in good faith. [100]\nExamples of evidence to demonstrate good faith entry into the marriage may include, but are not limited to:\nDocumentation that one spouse has been listed as the other spouse\u2019s beneficiary on insurance policies;\nJoint property leases, income tax forms, or accounts (for example, bank accounts, utility statements or accounts, and credit cards accounts);\nEvidence of courtship, a wedding ceremony, a shared residence, or shared experiences;\nBirth certificates of children born to the self-petitioner and abusive spouse;\nPolice, medical, or court documents providing information about the relationship;\nAffidavits of persons with personal knowledge of the relationship; or\nAny other credible evidence that demonstrates the self-petitioner\u2019s intentions for entering into the marriage.

Marriage-Related Prohibitions on Self-Petition Approval\n1. Self-Petitioning Spouses \u2013 Marriage While in Removal Proceedings\nWhen USCIS adjudicates a spousal self-petition, there are additional considerations on top of the requirements for a qualifying relationship and a good faith marriage. There is, for example, a prohibition on approving a self-petition if the marriage creating the qualifying relationship occurred while the self-petitioner was in removal proceedings. [17]\nThe self-petitioner may overcome the general prohibition by requesting an exemption in writing with Form I-360 and submitting evidence demonstrating the following: [18]\nThe self-petitioner has resided outside the United States for a 2-year period beginning after the date of the marriage; [19] or\nThe self-petitioner provides clear and convincing evidence that the marriage was entered into in good faith and in accordance with the laws of the place where the marriage took place, the marriage was not entered into to circumvent immigration laws, and no fee or other consideration was given for the filing of the self-petition. [20]\nIf USCIS denied a prior filing because the marriage took place during removal proceedings, and the self-petitioner then resided outside the United States for a period of 2 years following the marriage, the self-petitioner may file a new petition after the 2-year period. In addition, a denial does not prevent USCIS from considering a new petition or a motion to reopen if removal proceedings are terminated after the denial for any reason except the self-petitioner's departure from the United States. [21]\nAlthough self-petitioners may submit similar evidence to establish a good faith marriage or to qualify for the good faith marriage exemption while in removal proceedings, they must meet a heightened standard of proof when seeking a good faith marriage exemption.\nGenerally, self-petitioners must establish that they entered into the marriage in good faith by a preponderance of the evidence. [22] To be eligible for a good faith marriage exemption while in removal proceedings, however, a self-petitioner must establish good faith entry into the marriage by the more stringent clear and convincing evidence standard. [23] The heightened standard applies only to the good faith marriage exemption determination; all other eligibility requirements are reviewed under the preponderance of the evidence standard.\nThe requirement that no fee or other consideration was given for the filing of the petition does not refer to fees paid to attorneys, notarios, or other persons (distance: 0.7929776906967163)\n- A person is also eligible for naturalization under the spousal naturalization provisions if he or she had the conditions on his or her residence removed based on:\nAn approved\u00a0battery or extreme cruelty\u00a0waiver of the joint filing requirement for\u00a0Petition to\u00a0Remove\u00a0Conditions\u00a0on Residence ( Form I-751 ),\u00a0for\u00a0a\u00a0conditional\u00a0permanent resident, if the marriage was entered into in good faith and the spouse was subjected to\u00a0battery\u00a0or extreme cruelty by the\u00a0petitioning\u00a0citizen or LPR spouse.

Prior Marriage Fraud\nSelf-petitioning spouses are required to demonstrate a qualifying spousal relationship and that their marriage was entered into in good faith. [26] Even if the self-petitioner meets these two eligibility requirements, USCIS cannot approve the self-petition where it determines with substantial and probative evidence that the self-petitioner previously:\nHad been granted or has sought to be accorded an immediate relative or family-based preference status as the spouse of a U.S. citizen or LPR based on a marriage that USCIS has determined the self-petitioner entered into for the purpose of evading immigration laws; or\nAttempted or conspired to enter into a marriage for the purpose of evading immigration laws. [27]\nWhere USCIS determines there is substantial and probative evidence that the self-petitioner previously engaged in marriage fraud, the burden shifts to the self-petitioner to overcome the finding. [28] Officers may not rely solely on a prior finding of marriage fraud but must make a separate and independent determination that the self-petitioner previously engaged in marriage fraud. [29]\nUSCIS provides self-petitioners with an opportunity to rebut the evidence that they entered into or conspired to enter into a prior marriage for the purpose of evading immigration laws by issuing an Request for Evidence (RFE) or a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID).

However, the Board of Immigration Appeals in Matter of Hirabayashi(PDF) , 10 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 1964) determined a marriage may be valid if evidence establishes that the parties did not travel to the state of celebration with a primary purpose of evading prohibitions in their state of residence.\n[^ 16] There are no statutory minimum age requirements for the petitioner or beneficiary of a spousal immigration petition. However, USCIS evaluates whether the age of the beneficiary or petitioner, or both, at the time of marriage, violates the law of the place of celebration or violates the law or public policy of the state where the couple will reside.\n[^ 17] See INA 208(b)(3)(B) .\n[^ 18] See INA 207(c)(2)(B) .\n[^ 19] See INA 101(b)(1)(A)-(E) .\n[^ 20] See 8 CFR 207.7(c) and 8 CFR 208.21(b) .\n[^ 21] See Chapter 3, Admissibility and Waiver Requirements [ 4 USCIS-PM C.3 ].

Self-Petitioning Spouses \u2013 Marriage While in Removal Proceedings\nWhen USCIS adjudicates a spousal self-petition, there are additional considerations on top of the requirements for a qualifying relationship and a good faith marriage. There is, for example, a prohibition on approving a self-petition if the marriage creating the qualifying relationship occurred while the self-petitioner was in removal proceedings. [17]\nThe self-petitioner may overcome the general prohibition by requesting an exemption in writing with Form I-360 and submitting evidence demonstrating the following: [18]\nThe self-petitioner has resided outside the United States for a 2-year period beginning after the date of the marriage; [19] or\nThe self-petitioner provides clear and convincing evidence that the marriage was entered into in good faith and in accordance with the laws of the place where the marriage took place, the marriage was not entered into to circumvent immigration laws, and no fee or other consideration was given for the filing of the self-petition. [20]\nIf USCIS denied a prior filing because the marriage took place during removal proceedings, and the self-petitioner then resided outside the United States for a period of 2 years following the marriage, the self-petitioner may file a new petition after the 2-year period. In addition, a denial does not prevent USCIS from considering a new petition or a motion to reopen if removal proceedings are terminated after the denial for any reason except the self-petitioner's departure from the United States. [21]\nAlthough self-petitioners may submit similar evidence to establish a good faith marriage or to qualify for the good faith marriage exemption while in removal proceedings, they must meet a heightened standard of proof when seeking a good faith marriage exemption.\nGenerally, self-petitioners must establish that they entered into the marriage in good faith by a preponderance of the evidence. [22] To be eligible for a good faith marriage exemption while in removal proceedings, however, a self-petitioner must establish good faith entry into the marriage by the more stringent clear and convincing evidence standard. [23] The heightened standard applies only to the good faith marriage exemption determination; all other eligibility requirements are reviewed under the preponderance of the evidence standard.\nThe requirement that no fee or other consideration was given for the filing of the petition does not refer to fees paid to attorneys, notarios, or other persons (distance: 0.8781688213348389)\n- B.\u00a0Common Law Marriage\nThe concept of common law marriage presupposes an honest good-faith intention on the part of two persons, free to marry, to live together as husband and wife from the inception of the relationship. Some states recognize common law marriages and consider the parties to be married. [15] In order for a common law marriage to be valid for immigration purposes:\nThe parties must live in that jurisdiction; and\u200b\nThe parties must meet the qualifications for common law marriage for that jurisdiction.\nOther states may recognize a common law marriage contracted in another state even if the recognizing state does not accept common law marriage as a means for its own residents to contract marriage.\nUSCIS recognizes common law marriages for purposes of naturalization if the marriage was valid and recognized by the state in which the marriage was established. [16] This applies even if the naturalization application is filed in a jurisdiction that does not recognize or has never recognized the principle of common law marriage.\nThe officer should review the laws of the relevant jurisdiction on common law marriages to determine whether the applicant and spouse should be considered to be married for purposes of naturalization and when the marriage commenced.

Background\nBefore 1986, the law did not place conditions on an alien who obtained permanent resident status through a qualifying marriage less than 2 years old. Instead, the alien immediately received lawful permanent resident status without conditions. However, Congress believed that a significant number of aliens might have entered into these marriages to evade the U.S. immigration laws. [4]\nTherefore, Congress enacted the Immigration Marriage Fraud Amendments of 1986 (IMFA) to discourage the use of fraudulent marriages to obtain permanent residence in the United States. [5] Congress created conditions and a second review of the bona fides of the marriage to ensure that the alien entered into the marriage in good faith and not for the sole purpose of obtaining an immigration benefit.
